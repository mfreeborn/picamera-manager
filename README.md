# Picamera Manager

Picamera Manager is a pair of programs which allow the user to monitor and manage multiple Raspberry Pi cameras from a central device across a local network.

A typical set up would involve running the `server` application on an appropriate server, along with one or more Raspberry Pi cameras running the `camera` application.
